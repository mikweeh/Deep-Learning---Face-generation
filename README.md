# Face generation

## Introduction

This is a project from Udacity's nanodegree Deep Learning. It consists of generating random faces from a dataset of famous people faces, as realistic as posible.

Te project is done on Jupyter Notebook using pytorch and it has to be made with DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks)



## Getting the project files

The project files can be found in Udacity's public GitHub repo: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/, in the project-face-generation folder.

You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer. This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.
